# Retail-Customer-Analytics
# Business Problem
A Retail store is required to analyze the day-to-day transactions and keep a track of its customers spread across various locations along with their purchases/returns across various categories.

Create a report that segements the customers, calculates the Customer Lifetime Value and Market basket analysis


# Approach Used:
The retail customer analytics report encompasses various analytical techniques applied to a retail dataset to derive valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and market trends. The approach involved data cleaning, manipulation, and the application of several analytical methods, including RFM analysis, customer lifetime value (CLV) prediction, and market basket analysis.
Data Cleaning and Summary Statistics: Initial data cleaning tasks were performed to prepare the dataset for analysis. Summary statistics were generated to gain a preliminary understanding of the data.

RFM Analysis:

RFM analysis was conducted using both ranking methods and K-means clustering to segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.
Customers were categorized into different segments such as Core, Loyal, To be retained, New Customers, Luxury, Challenge, and Personalized based on their RFM scores.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction:

CLV prediction was carried out using RFM features to estimate the total revenue expected from a customer throughout the business relationship.
Machine learning models, including logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and decision tree classifier, were trained and evaluated to predict CLV categories.

Market Basket Analysis:

Market basket analysis was performed to identify associations between products frequently purchased together by customers.
Association rules were generated using the Apriori algorithm, and key performance indicators such as support, confidence, and lift were evaluated to understand the strength of associations between items.

# Insights:

RFM analysis revealed different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized offers.

CLV prediction helped in identifying high-value customers and tailoring marketing efforts towards segments likely to yield high revenue.

Market basket analysis uncovered associations between products, enabling retailers to make strategic decisions regarding product placement, marketing campaigns, and cross-selling strategies.

# Conclusion:

The comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and market dynamics. By leveraging techniques such as RFM analysis, CLV prediction, and market basket analysis, retailers can optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, and maximize revenue potential.

# Recommendations:

Implement personalized marketing campaigns targeted towards different customer segments identified through RFM analysis to improve customer engagement and loyalty.
Focus on retaining high-value customers by offering exclusive benefits and incentives tailored to their preferences.

Utilize association rules generated from market basket analysis to optimize product placement, cross-selling, and bundling strategies to drive sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

Continuously monitor and analyze customer data to adapt strategies and stay competitive in the dynamic retail landscape.
